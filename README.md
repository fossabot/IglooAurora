# Igloo Aurora

Igloo Aurora is a client for Igloo Cloud Framework that allows you to view the individual values of every device. If you need a more comprehensive summary of your data stored on Igloo Cloud Framework, please check [Igloo Magellan](http:https://github.com/hellowitlab/iglooMagellan).

This service is still in development, some features may be missing. If your Igloo-based project needs a missing feature in order to work, please check for future updates or help us by contributing.
