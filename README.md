<h1 align="center">Igloo Aurora</h1>

Aurora is the official Igloo app. It is a Progressive Web App available on every major operating system.

This service is still in development, some features may be missing. If your Igloo-based project needs a missing feature in order to work, please check for future updates or help us by contributing.

## Getting started
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FIglooCloud%2FIglooAurora.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FIglooCloud%2FIglooAurora?ref=badge_shield)


If you plan to use a custom version of Igloo Aurora, you will need to host the web app yourself. However, if you do not have this need, we suggest to use the public website of Igloo Aurora.

### Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igloocloud/IglooAurora
yarn
