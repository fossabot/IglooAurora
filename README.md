# Igloo Magellan
Igloo Magellan is a client for Igloo Cloud Frameowkr that shows your data on a map based on GPS coordinates. If you need to have access to the individual values of each device (e.g. for small projects or debugging), we suggest checking [Igloo Aurora](https://github.com/hellowitlab/iglooAurora).
